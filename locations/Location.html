	<h4>City of Angels</h4>
	<p>I moved to LA the January of 2020, and till now the experience has been serene. It seems that the beautiful weather is almost corelated to the culture and spirit of this place. USC has been a joyride, while the envirnoment is challenging yet excelerating. From the mountains to the beaches, every day feels like a new experience, a depiction of the wanderlust of this city. </p>

	<h4>Home of the Scarlet Knights</h4>
	<p>I spent five months in New Brunswick, New Jersey when I enrolled to Rutgers University. The city was as wholesome as the people who occupied this beautiful city. The pleasant calm of the land is addicting. Rutgers felt like a blurry dream, full of wonderful memories that passed by in a second. The friendships I made and the experience of being a part of something as big as the institution was truly unique.</p>

	<h4>The City that Never Sleeps</h4>
	<p>There is not enough words in the Enlish dictionary to describe what a gem of a city New York is. The five boroughs with their own flavor yet integrated into one to deliver an everlasting life experience.The the energy it exerts is empowering and makes one feel larger than life. The hustle that is encorporated with the daily lifestyle of the people truly changes a person, for the better. I parted ways with this city with a heavy heart, although it's not a goodbye forever, I truly miss the New York for how it has transformed me as a person. </p>

	<h4>Root to a Million Heartbeats</h4>
	<p>One has to look deeply to find the hidden beauty of this home to a several million. The narrow streets and the evergreen fields is where I grew up. I feel this city has made me humble and kept me rooted to the meaning of family. Growing up I had the priviledge to call one of the most beautiful neighborhoods, Dhanmondi, my home. Not only the place, but also the people who reside here, are special and one of a kind. </p>
